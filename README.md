A simple app using `steem.js` and [React](https://reactjs.org) to show the followers for a user.


### Installation
You will be needing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which includes npm. Go download it and run the installer.

To check if it was installed, open a terminal and run `node -v`and `npm -v`. I get:

``` js
node -v
v8.4.0
npm -v
5.3.0
```


### Run the app

```
npm install
npm start

```
